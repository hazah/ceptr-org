### Transnational Republics of Commoning
Sunday July 9th, 2017
9:30 AM Pacific - 12:30 PM Eastern - 6:30 PM Central Europe

Join us for an online conversation exploring new forms of digital commons with examples from the empowered humans over at Enspiral and other communities.

The super-dork-fun discussion prompt for this Salon is a short portion of a report by David Bollier called  "Transnational Republics of Commoning".  We'll focus on the section "Digital Commons as New Species of Production and Governance", which is on pdf pages 10-16.

This topic lands as a bit of a bridge between some of our recent more general conversations on governance and a more detailed exploration of the types of tools that Ceptr and others are creating to support new forms of relationship and organization.

The article is a short read. Please bring comments or questions to this 90 minute online salon so we can explore this terrain together.

### Broken Assumptions of Governance
Sunday June 11th, 2017

9:30 AM Pacific - 12:30 PM Eastern - 6:30 PM Central Europe

Join us for a dialogue with Metacurrency co-founder Arthur Brock about the Broken Assumptions of Governance.

"To meet the huge challenges confronting us, we need more than incremental digital tweaks, we need a breakthrough in large-scale collective wisdom."

### The Future of Governance is not Governments
Sunday May 28th, 2017

Metacurrency co-founder Arthur Brock argues that our governmental institutions don't have the bandwidth to keep up with a world that is changing as rapidly as ours is and suggests that we need to create new governance mechanisms using bottom-up, digital social networks.

### The Right to be Forgotten
Sunday May 13th, 2017

Inspired by Maciej Cegłowski’s [recent suggestion](http://idlewords.com/talks/build_a_better_monster.htm) that we “teach social software to forget, to give it predictable security properties, and to sever the financial connection between online advertising and extremism.”
