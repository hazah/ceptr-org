excerpt: "We present a scalable, evolvable, agent-centric distributed computing platform.  We use a  formalism to characterize distributed systems, show how it applies to some existing distributed systems and demonstrate the benefits of shifting from a data-centric to an agent-centric model. We present the a detailed formal specification of the Holochain system, along with an analysis of its systemic integrity, capacity for evolution, total system computational complexity, implications for use-cases, and current implementation status."
