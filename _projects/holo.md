## Overview

[Holo](holo.host) is a platform that gives web users access to decentralised [Holochain](/projects/holochain) applications. Developers use Holo with their Holochain applications to allow easy access from a browser. End users can then access decentralised apps by just typing in a url.  No installation of the Holochain software required.

People who do install a Holochain node, or buy a dedicated device, can run Holo hosting software. These hosts earn cryptocurrency for providing their extra computing space to the network. Developers pay hosts to service users without their own Holochain node in Holo fuel.

## Crowdfunding

We are currently [crowdfunding](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/holo-the-peer-to-peer-internet-has-arrived-money-community) to be able to build out the Holo platform.

Through this campaign we're offering the Holoport -- a device that makes it easy to join a community of hosters and earn Holo fuel, a mutual-credit cryptocurrency.  The crowdfunding also includes "perks" where our team will come and run a hackathon in your community, or even build a prototype Holochain application.

## Apps Ecosystem
These are some of the applications that support an edge-hosted application ecosystem, and that we want for our own project, so we will be developing them in this phase of the project.

- Distributed PKI
- Distributed Directories
- Rating/Tagging/Annotation
- Chat & Social posting
- Distributed Content Delivery Network
- A crypto-reputation-currency akin to a bit torrent sharing ratio
- A mutual-credit cryptocurrency for micro transactions and settlement of hosting imbalances.
