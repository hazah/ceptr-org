There’s been quite a bit of movement in Ceptr development over the  last few weeks, so I wanted to just give brief overview of what’s going on.  The big news is that we’ve broken the Ceptr development effort into some smaller sub-projects that are each independently valuable .  Not only does this make the effort more manageable, but, we hope, will increase surface area for participation.

One of these sub-project, which we’re calling [holochain](/whitepapers/holochain), provides the distributed data-store for Ceptr.  This part of the project has been on the [drawing board for quite a while](https://medium.com/metacurrency-project/beyond-blockchain-simple-scalable-cryptocurrencies-1eb7aebac6ae#.ohn1sgvqu), but in these last weeks I’ve been on a coding sprint to get out a working prototype, the progress of which you can [see here](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto).

The code in the [current repo](https://github.com/zippy/ceptr) will to get broken out into two separate projects:  The first will be what we're calling Pcubed for Plugable Protocol for Protocol’s.  This will extract into a separate library our semantic-trees and semtrex engine that allows us to build that meta-protocol for specifying protocols.  The second will be ceptr-core, which binds together holochain and Pcubed with the Virtual Machine Host to provide our fractal receptor compute fabric.

I’ve jumped to [golang](http://golang.org) for holochain development, and I’m pretty sure that when we break the current ceptr C code-base into it’s sub-parts that we’ll covert to go too.

More about the other sub-projects later as we produce documentation!
