<p>We've been asked to present our work on Ceptr via an MIT webinar as part of their (Kerberos and Internet Trust) series highlighting notablenew technologies. You can find the event <a href="http://kit.mit.edu/seminars/2015/kit-webinar-series-april-2015" target="_blank">on the MIT web</a> site, and participate. We'll post a recording to this site afterward.</p>
<p>We've been building all kinds of low-level underlying tech in Ceptr, but it's hard to make that kind of stuff visible to an end-user rather than a programmer. For this call, so that people can actually <strong>see</strong>what's happening under the hood, we've created some video demos and some visualization interfaces to render the underlying semantic trees in a web-browser via JavaScript.</p>

<p>Here's a preview of some of what we'll be showing.</p>

<p><strong>DEMO:</strong> The first demo is Ceptr-like, not actually Ceptr, it is of H.O.P.E (<a href="http://www.higherorderprogramming.com/" target="_blank">Higher Order Programming</a> Environment) built by Marc Clifton usingreceptor and membrane computing similar to Ceptr. Marc has also been building C# interfaces in Windows directly on top of our code from github, but this video he recorded helpsyou see the kinds of interactions receptors have.</p>

<p><strong>Ceptr RunTrees:</strong> Eric also made a recording showing how the underlying semantic trees in Ceptr which store data and code, can be used as a kind of semantic stack which "eats itself" as it processes leaving behind the result of the processing.</p>

<p>We're building all of these things into a Prezi for the call (which we'll post here as well when we're done building it).</p>
<p>Enjoy this opportunity to <strong>see</strong> what's going on inside all this low-level code. :)</p>
